Introduction To Our Project
--------------------------------------
The project our team is currently working on is to develop a website which is totally devoted to Games. The main purpose of the website
is to offer the users a platform from where they can access everything related to games. The website is distributed into three main sections
which are as follows.

The Gaming store:
	The store section is generally a place where the user can buy games at low price than the usual with all the updated and
	remastered versions of games with special offers and great deals occasionally. Moreover, if you have a game no longer in use,
	the store section offers you a chance to sell it online with authentic buyers(Terms & Conditions apply).

The Affiliate Program:
	"Want to earn some money rather than just spending it on games?" Become a part of our Affiliate program. Our Affiliate
	program works like this:
	
	1.) Sign up with our website to get a authentic verified account.
	2.) Join the Affiliate program for free
	3.) Link your any other Social media source (Website, Blog, Instagram, etc.) and share the link of our games on your platform
	for others to buy it. For every sell of a game within 24hrs through your link will provide you 2.5% of the purchase made.

The Learning Section:
	We aim to not only provide user the privilege of buying games, but we also tend to provide tutorials and lessons on how to
	create your own 2D or 3D games using the easiest and elaborated ways. The lessons can also be done on demand so the user
	can always drop off their ideas in the comment section.
